📌 Overview

This project is an AI-powered real-time weapon detection system that uses a trained YOLO model to detect weapons (e.g., guns, knives) from live camera feeds or video input. Upon detecting a weapon, the system automatically sends an alert message (with image) via Telegram to notify the responsible authority or individual.

This project aims to enhance public safety and security in places like schools, public buildings, and critical infrastructures.

🎯 Key Features
✅ Real-time weapon detection using YOLOv11

🔍 High-accuracy detection of dangerous items (guns, knives)

📷 Support for webcam, video files, or IP camera streams

📩 Automatic Telegram alert with snapshot when weapon is detected

📈 Trained on a custom dataset of weapon images
